# testC6
This is a test for learning Transfer Learning with the model of inception_v3.
The photo folder “flower_photos” (hidden) is a folder of test data which need to be downloaded from Google.
The result just not good with a final accuracy rate below 0.3, so is there anybody who can help me in finding bugs causing this result?
